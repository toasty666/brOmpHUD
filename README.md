A hud for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

brOmpHUD is a modified HUD created by toasty using OmpHUD + broeselhud. It aims to be as minimalist as unobtrusive as possible. The font improves on broesels and is also colour coded for easier reading during the midst of battle.

This HUD is a combination of parts from my personal favourite custom HUDs rolled into one. 
These other HUDS include:
* e.v.e HUD (Main Menu, taunt menu stylized to fit with OmpHUD)
* notoHUD (3D Models)
* OmpHUD (Original base of bromphud)
* broeselhud (Weapon and Ammo based on broesel's)
